      "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q4 2009 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Phil Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.\n",
      "Good morning, and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly & Co.'s Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our President, CEO and Chairman, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Steve Paul; and Ronika Pletcher and Nick Lemen from Investor Relations.During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decision. You can access the earnings press release, supporting materials, a live webcast and Internet-based replay and a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com. The supporting materials, the replay and the podcast will be available on our website through February 26, 2009.We accomplished a great deal in 2009 by once again delivering strong financial performance in a tough environment. As well as by implementing a series of actions in the speeding innovation to patients and delivering greater value to our customers. Just as we have done in the past three quarters, in the fourth quarter, we generated strong volume-driven revenue growth. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, we also have generated an increase in gross margin as a percent revenue, leverage between revenue growth and operating income growth, robust EPS growth and strong operating cash flow. Our Q4 results capped a year of strong operating financial performance. This financial performance gives us the resources we need to strengthen and progress our pipeline, to invest in our transformation allowing us to speed development and improve our competitiveness in key therapeutic areas and geographies, to streamline our cost base, to deal with the patent expiration coming later this decade and to respond to a challenging healthcare environment.We will face our major patent expiration as a leaner more agile company. A company focused on innovation with a strong pipeline. Operating more efficiently and effectively and well positioned to resume sustained and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn the call over to John for a view of key events since our last earnings call.\n",
      "Thanks, Phil. Since our last earnings call, we continued our efforts to strengthen our operations and effectively utilize our resources typified by the following. Lilly signed a co-promotion agreement with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America to commercialize Livalo in the U.S. In addition, we entered into a licensing agreement with Kowa Company, Limited to market Livalo in Latin America. Livalo is a statin approved by the FDA in August 2009 for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. On January 1, 2010, the company completed the sale of its Tippecanoe manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana to Evonik Industries. Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb restructured our existing collaboration agreement to allow for the co-development and co-commercialization of necitumumab or IMC-11F8 in the U.S., Canada and Japan.Lilly also continued its effort to strengthen and advance our pipeline with the announcement of an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Incyte Corporation for the development and commercialization of Incyte's oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.On the regulatory front, Lilly received a number of regulatory approvals, including FDA approval of a Zyprexa Relprevv long-acting injection for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Byetta as monotherapy along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. And Zyprexa in tablet form as an option for the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adolescents.The European Commission approved Adcirca as a once daily treatment option to improve exercise capacity for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, or IPAH, and PAH associated with connective tissue diseases in WHO functional classes two and three. The product also received regulatory approval in Canada and Japan. And finally, Shinogi received approval from Japanese regulatory authorities of Cymbalta for the treatment of depression.Before passing the call over to Derica, I would like to take a moment to once again recognize the efforts of Steve Paul, who is participating today in his last earnings call for Lilly. Steve will retire at the end of February after 17 years of service to Lilly. Under Steve's leadership, we built the most robust pipeline in Lilly's history with more than 60 molecules in the clinic, including 29 in Phases II and III. Steve also helped recruit many of LRLs [Lilly Research Laboratories] top scientific leaders during his 17 years here at the company. And he's played a key role in transforming Lilly's R&D to position us for the future. Steve's successor will be Dr. Jan Lundberg, former Executive Vice President and Head of Global Discovery Research at AstraZeneca. Over the past decade, Jan had a hand in delivering some 150 drug candidates to AstraZeneca's pipeline. Dr. Lundberg received his training at Sweden's Karolinska Institute, where he spent 18 years involved in academic research before joining the industry. Now Derica will discuss our fourth quarter financial results.\n",
      "Thanks, John. As I've done on previous calls, I'll focus my comments on the pro forma non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view assumes we own ImClone as of January 1, 2008, and it excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. Now let's start on Slide 8 with a quick look at our fourth quarter income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a pro forma non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated strong revenue growth of 13% in the fourth quarter, while operating income fell 10%. This reduction in operating income was driven by a 6.4 percentage point drop in our gross margin percent. The decrease in gross margin percent from 82.3% to 75.9% is due to the unfavorable impact of cost of sales arising from the effect of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on the international inventories sold in the period. Specifically, changes in the foreign currency value of the U.S. dollar lowered cost of sales in Q4 of 2008 while increasing cost of sales in Q4 of 2009.In December, we shared information with you on the trend in our gross margin as a percent of revenue, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international inventories sold. Now many of you commented that this information was helpful. In the supplemental slides, you'll see that we've updated the slide we presented in December and that we have also provided gross margin as a percent of revenue for each quarter of 2008 and 2009, both with and without this FX effect.This quarter's operating expenses defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew slightly less than sale. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew 12%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside of the U.S. and the impact of foreign exchange rate. While R&D expense grew 10% due to increased incentive compensation and increased late stage clinical trial costs.Moving down the income statement, you will see the improvement in other income due to lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by about two percentage points. Net income and earnings per share declined 10% and 11%, respectively. Due to the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our cost of goods sold, as I previously mentioned.Now for the year, you can see that we generated leverage between revenue and operating income as revenue grew 5%, while operating income grew a robust 15%. This leverage between revenue and operating income was driven by a 2.2 percentage point expansion in our gross margin percent. Net income and earnings per share both grew 16%.Now Slide 9 shows our reported income statement while Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and pro forma non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q4 results starting with revenue. As you can see on Slide 11, for the fourth quarter, total revenue growth of 13% on a pro forma basis includes a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. After that impact, total revenue grew 10% driven by a robust 6% volume growth. This robust volume growth was consistent across all major geographies. Japan's substantial volume growth was largely driven by a Alimta's mid-2009 approval for both first line and second line non-small cell lung cancer.For the year, total revenue growth of 5% on a pro forma basis includes a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Absent that impact, total revenue grew 8% driven by 5% volume growth.On Slide 12, we provided the price, rate and volume analysis on a reported basis. Now let's look at the rest of the income statement.  Slide 13 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our pro forma non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. Now the numbers in the first column are the same as you saw earlier on our pro forma non-GAAP income statement. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the impact of foreign exchange rate on our pro forma non-GAAP results.First, for the quarter, you'll see the 10% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see a 3% growth in cost of sales, while operating expenses grew slightly less than revenue this quarter. The 9% performance growth in operating expenses was driven by increases of 9% in both marketing, selling and administrative expenses and R&D expenses. Our 10% performance growth in revenue translated into 15% performance growth in operating income and 16% in EPS. Finally, you'll see in the last column that for the year, we grew revenue faster than both cost of sales and operating expenses leading to 14% performance growth in operating income and EPS.Now for your information, on Slide 14, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. Comparisons of 2009 to 2008 operating income and EPS are not meaningful due to charges taken in 2008. Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. We reconfirm the 2010 financial guidance provided at our investor meeting in December. This guidance excludes the potential impact of healthcare reform in the U.S. And also as a reminder, our guidance reflects earnings per share of $4.65 to $4.85 on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. In terms of line item guidance, we expect total revenue to grow in the high single digits, driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, Animal Health, Effient and the exenatide franchise. We anticipate gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be flat to declining. However, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, we expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Research and development expenses are projected to grow in the low double digits. Other income for the year is expected to be a net deduction of between $150 million and $200 million and the effective tax rate for the full year should be approximately 22%.Finally, we expect cash flows to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend. Slide 16 provides a reconciliation between reported and pro forma non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2010 guidance. Now let me turn the call over to Nick and Ronica for our product review and pipeline update. Nick?\n",
      "Thanks, Derica. The last two quarterly calls, we discussed underlying prescription and shared market trends for several of our major products. Since we just provided detailed product updates at our meeting in December, this quarter, we'll take a look at three recently completed business development transactions. As mentioned earlier, in late December, Lilly entered into a co-promotion agreement in the U.S. and a licensing agreement in Latin America with Kowa to market Livalo. We are pleased to partner with Kowa and are excited to help bring this new statin to market. Livalo is in HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor approved by the FDA for patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol LDL-C, Apo B and triglycerides while increasing HDL-C. Livalo was approved by the FDA in August of 2009 and the drug has been marketed in Japan since 2003.This deal enables us to more effectively utilize our current sales force as it allows us to expand our product offerings in the cardiovascular therapeutic area, an area of high focus given the launch of Effient. While Livalo effectively lowers bad cholesterol similar to other prominent statins, Livalo will offer physicians an additional option for their patients who may not be responding to or tolerating their current treatment and for their more complex patients treated with multiple medications and at a risk of potential drug interaction that may occur with some of the currently available statins. Lilly and Kowa are working towards a mid-2010 launch of Livalo in the U.S., where Kowa will record sales and pay Lilly an undisclosed co-promotion fee based upon net sales. Under the U.S. agreement, the party shared cost of commercialization and development equally and Kowa is responsible for manufacturing the product while Lilly is responsible for distribution. The undisclosed upfront payment to Kowa will be amortized over the product's remaining patent life and will be booked to collaboration of the revenue. The agreement runs for the life of the patent, which has a current expiration date of January 2016. Kowa has applied for the five-year patent term extension.In Latin America, Lilly plans to submit Livalo to regulatory agencies during the second half of 2010, and hopes to launch Livalo by mid-2011. The agreement in Latin America is for a period of 10 years from product launch. In late December, Lilly also announced that it entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of Incyte's oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, INCB28050, currently in Phase II. The addition of this asset serves to further bolster our inflammatory and autoimmune disease pipeline. The asset is currently in an ongoing placebo controlled Phase II dose ranging study that has enrolled 100 patients with RA [rheumatoid arthritis]. After three months of treatment, patients in the placebo arm will crossover and receive active drug and the study will continue for another three months. We also plan to run a larger Phase IIb trial, which will generate the data necessary to inform dose selection for Phase III. To this point, there have been no scientific data disclosures on INCB28050. The current data disclosure plan includes sharing six-month data on the ongoing Phase II trial in patients with RA at the ACR meeting in October of this year. With Incyte also planning to share top line three-month results some time in the first half of the year.Lilly is very excited about this opportunity given that RA and other autoimmune diseases are chronic, debilitating diseases that still present an unmet medical need. The current therapeutic continuum typically starts with oral agents such as methotrexate but a significant proportion of patients are not well controlled. And therefore, typically move to biologics, most commonly the anti-TNFs. Even in patients receiving anti-TNFs, only about 50% achieve good ACR 50 response. Therefore, the normal treatment for these patients is to cycle one therapy to the next. If INCB28050 is successful with a favorable benefit risk profile, it could be positioned higher up the therapeutic continuum than anti-TNFs and therefore, not in direct competition with our own internal portfolio of biologics.We hope that our internal antibodies will be positioned at least initially as the treatment of choice following the failure of anti-TNF therapy. As safety and efficacy data on these assets increases, these compounds could assume a role as first line biologic after failure of oral therapy. Ronika?\n",
      "As John mentioned earlier, in January, Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb restructured our existing collaboration agreement to allow for the co-development and co-commercialization of necitumumab, or IMC-11F8, which is currently in Phase III clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer. Necitumumab is a fully humanized version of Erbitux. Lilly and BMS will share the cost of developing and potentially commercializing necitumumab in the U.S., Canada and Japan. Lilly retains full rights to the asset in other markets around the world.Now I'll provide a brief update on our pipeline. Our pipeline slide demonstrates changes since our December 10 Analyst Meeting as of January 21. The recent addition is in progress of our compounds further underline our robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 64 distinct entities, including 29 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We continue to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent nearly half of our late stage Phase II and III assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. Our focus remains unchanged, advancing our pipeline as our number one priority. As reflected by the arrows on Slide 20 since our last formal portfolio review, we have advanced one oncology asset to Phase I; promoted three assets to Phase II, one for diabetes, a glucose kinase activator, one for psoriasis our anti-IL-23 antibody and one for cancer, an Eg5 inhibitor. Added our previously mentioned, new in-lines [ph] of asset INCB28050 and JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor for RA in Phase II advanced Tasisulam to Phase III as first patient visit occurred in late December. Added Livalo to our co-promotion and licensing agreement with Kowa in the U.S. and Latin America and finally, one Phase I oncology asset was terminated.Now let's turn to Slide 21 to highlight selected milestones between now and mid-2010. Both Lilly and our partner, Amylin expect exenatide once weekly new [ph] several fronts including: potential action by the FDA on exenatide once weekly NDA; submission of exenatide once weekly to the European Medicines Agency; results from our DURATION-4 monotherapy trial; initiation of our exenatide one weekly cardiovascular outcomes study, EXSCEL, designed to show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes; as well as initiation of DURATION-6, our open-label study of exenatide once weekly versus liraglutide. For Cymbalta, we could have FDA action on the chronic pain sNDA and we will initiate the GLP-1 Fc Phase III AWARD program.This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please.\n",
      "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bert Hazlett at BMO Capital Markets.\n",
      "On the cardiovascular franchise, you licensed Livalo you've had the launch ongoing. What's the platelet blocker? Do you expect this to be an area where you focus on in terms of licensing? And then secondly, looking at your Zyprexa Relprevv long-acting risperidone is well above $1 billion globally, could you just frame your expectations for Zyprexa Relprevv?\n",
      "Bert, this is Phil. With the formation of our new structure, each of the various areas that we have designated will be focused on developing sustainable long-term businesses. That will include, not only advancing molecules that come out of our own research laboratories, but continued in-licensing and business development. With regard to Zyprexa Relprevv, we still view this as an important opportunity to provide additional attractive option for patients, particularly those that are difficult to control their symptoms of schizophrenia. We're currently in the process of rolling out that product in Europe. As you know, I think you're aware there are some significant requirements in terms of prepping the market, making sure that physicians in various centers are properly trained. Here in the U.S., we're in the beginning stages of a similar process and would expect to fully launch that product here stateside in the middle part of this year.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of Catherine Arnold at Credit Suisse.\n",
      "I wanted to get your reaction on some level to Effient's performance. I know you're building access, I know it's early days, I know we're in a different world in regards to launches and the uptake versus the same. Even considering all of that, I guess, I would think you would be disappointed with the early results of the product. And I wondered if you could react to that and tell me have you readjusted marketing plans? Have you changed the team? Is there anything going on behind the scenes that might sort of give us a little bit more confidence in sort of to change in execution here? And then could you talk about the Kowa deal in terms of if you don't hit financial targets for that collaboration, is there an opportunity to exit that down the road?\n",
      "Catherine, I think that first of all, it's important to point out that the indication we have approved for Effient, which is treatment for patients experiencing ACS who are undergoing PCI, it represents -- we have one slice in the pie in terms of the total range of indications that for example, the competitive product has. So I think we haven't made dramatic changes in direction, we're obviously responding as you would expect us to the inputs that we get from pairs, from our physician customers as we understand better what we need to do to get the product properly positioned, and to take advantage of a rather compelling data set to help physicians understand the advantages that we believe Effient can offer for many patients. So we're going to stick with the plans that we have in place now. we're pleased with the level of the access that we're gaining unrestricted in Tiers 2 and 3, the placement now of the product in the cath labs of hospitals that account for well over 50% of all the procedures, the stent placement procedures. So I think we're not put off by the initial results of this product by any means. We remain very confident in it. As you know, we have the medical management trial well underway now. So both companies, Lilly and Daiichi are going to continue to be thoughtful, but continue to be very supportive of making sure that Effient has the very best chance to succeed.\n",
      "One additional point on the Effient as well. We now have on hand some of the promotional materials that have been approved by DNMC. We'll be putting those in the hands of the sales reps starting in February, so we're excited about that. With regards to Kowa , we have not disclose the financial provisions or the termination provision to that agreement, Catherine. So unfortunately I can't help you with that question.\n",
      "Catherine, one last thing with regard to the building of access that continues to progress well as John mentioned. In December, we've had the hearing in the U.S., we were currently approved in stocking [ph] cath labs that perform about 50% of PCIs here in the U.S. and that's now an excess of 60%. We'd like that to continue to build nicely over the coming month, so we are able to much more fully compete for those new patients coming on getting those stenting procedures.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of John Boris of Citi.\n",
      "First question just has to do with foreign exchange. Derica, can you just give us some color on what your assumption is for foreign exchange going into 2010? And then question on Cymbalta, the sNDA that was filed for chronic pain was scheduled to have ad comm and then the FDA canceled that. Does that have implications or have you been notified by the FDA about an extension of that PDUFA date or that commitment? And then can you provide any color on the last safety update that you provided to the FDA on Cymbalta? I would assume that that's something that's ongoing of which -- is there a label change on the horizon or something to that effect that you might be expecting? And then just on the rollout, if you were to secure approval, is Quintiles still instantly involved with -- the relationship with them, whether they would be assisting you in the rollout of that chronic pain indications?\n",
      "John, in regards to the FX effect on 2010, if rates were to stay where they are today, we would expect to see a modest improvement on both the sales line and the international income line associated with that versus the dollar. We would expect also see the opposite being of our cost of goods sold line, similar to what you've seen here in the fourth quarter of 2009. That would obviously, for the year it would be more modest than what you saw in the fourth quarter. But you would see an increase in our cost of goods sold due to the FX effect if rates stayed where they are today.\n",
      "John, on your three Cymbalta questions. The FDA has not communicated any kind of an extension to the PDUFA date. There has been no major amendment declared, so we still have the same PDUFA date that we had earlier. The safety information essentially was provided as part of the routine 120 days safety update. We did submit one new efficacy and safety study as part of that update, and that study did not show any new safety signal. And then lastly, there's not currently any active motion agreement with Quintiles. As you may recall from the original agreement, they will have a residual payment coming to them over the next three years as a result of their original involvement with the promotion of the product.\n",
      "And that will come from the line of Tim Anderson at Sandsford Bernstein.\n",
      "This is Jay Olson for Tim Anderson. First, could you please share with us your latest thinking about the competitive landscape in the GOP-1 category, with the recent approval of Victoza and how that might impact Byetta? And secondly, your thoughts on the potential risk for therapeutic substitution of Cymbalta with Zyprexa when it goes generic later this year and how you plan to manage that?\n",
      "I think the launch of Liraglutide here in the U.S. obviously changes the landscape here. But keep in mind they've been -- that product has been available in Europe for a number of months now. One of the things that we've observed in a couple of those markets in Europe is that the overall market in this category is expanding. And so I think that to some degree, if that happens here, all boats will rise as it were. We're going to emphasize in the process of meeting the competitive challenge of the entry of the second product. We're going to emphasize the fact that we have treaters Byetta has been used in over 1 million patients. I think there have been 10 million or so prescriptions written. We think we have a very good understanding of the benefit risk profile of Byetta to products that's been used and trusted by physicians and patients. And I think that base of experience we have will be important. Obviously, we're looking forward to the approval of the once-weekly version of Exenatide, which we think has the potential to offer even more advantages.\n",
      "In relation to the competition that could come with generic effects or later, we continue to believe the Cymbalta's got a unique profile that positions it quite strongly in the marketplace. With the approved indications in major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, DPMP in fibromyalgia. That position will be further strengthened should we received the approval in chronic pain. As we have presented in December 2009 as well as December 2008, even with strong generic competition already in that marketplace with a variety of products that have gone generic, as well as the launch of Pristiq for example, Cymbalta has continued to perform quite well among those branded products. So we're optimistic about the future despite the continued generic pressures that we will see.\n",
      "And we'll go to the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.\n",
      "Could you please comment on the outlook for FORTEO going forward, what type of growth you're expecting? And also discuss the implications of Denosumab if that's approved? And then second, could you just discuss the key type line events that investors should be watching in 2010 beyond LAR?\n",
      "With regards to FORTEO, we feel very good about the lift we've gotten so far with the FORTEO connect program, where we have a more hands-on approach of helping patients initiate therapy and stay on and work through their therapy. So we saw a good start to that program last year, and we hope to continue to see good subscription to that program going into 2010 as well. With regards to Denosumab, we really believe that Denosumab is again going to be viewed as a resorptive, much like some of the disphosphonates (sic) [diphosphonates] and could be positioned similar to Reclast. We believe that FORTEO continues to be unique and that it is an anabolic and it does build new bone. And so we feel that there is still going to be a strong for FORTEO, even with the potential strong competition from Denosumab.\n",
      "Dave, with regards to pipeline events, I'm going to initially make my connection with two of the movements that were recently announced, at least today, announced with regards to IL-23. IL-23 was promoted into the next phase. Later this year, we should have that proof of concept data available. I'm not sure what medical meeting it will be available at, but that's some new information that will be out there as well as our GKA [Glucokinase Activator] as well, we'll have a data presentation or publication later next year. But that was one of the two that were promoted. We also hope to have some Phase II phase advanced data with regard to the hitmion [ph] compound early this year as well. And also something that's gotten a lot of attention with our GLP-1 Fc program, the initiation our Award program which is the full Phase III program.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan.\n",
      "Just a series of GLP-1 questions. I would starting with that GLP-1 Fc Phase III program. Just also update us in terms of just how we should think about timing of completion of that program, how long we should expect on that front? And now you're monitoring gall stone levels with that Phase III program? Maybe then taking a step back as it relates to the GLP-1 portfolio. Do you expect the black box warning you saw on your competitor's label is going to be something that's product specific or something that could be applied to all long-acting GLP-1s until there's more information on this? And then finally, when you receive FDA approval for Byetta LAR, do you need to expend the resources dedicated to the GLP-1 franchise or should we think about support maybe in line or is partly seeing on Byetta?\n",
      "In terms of the GLP Fc timing of completion, at this point the team is essentially finalizing protocols. A number of these are likely to appear over the next few months. So I prefer to wait to comment on the potential timing until that process has completed, Chris, but that should be something again, I'd say within the next couple of months. Trials will be finalized and protocols posted to clinicaltrials.gov for that Award program. My expectations would be it's likely we wouldn't measure capitone [ph] unclear based on some of the discussions that you may have seen and communications from FDA as they talked about the regulatory approval, whether or not these are particularly meaningful. And in fact, whether implementing this in practice could in fact lead to additional surgeries that are really not necessary. Black box being product specific, clearly each one of these products does have a different data set with regard to pre-clinical and clinical data. In the case of Byetta and the Exenatide molecule, we also have a substantial amount data from the marketing of the product over the last five years or so. So our expectation would be that the FDA will in fact look at the data sets that the different companies have generated for the different molecules to make a determination of what the appropriate labeling is for that molecule. And in terms of expanding resources, my understanding is that at this point in time, we are essentially resourced along with Amylin to support our launch of Exenatide once weekly. Obviously, we'll be monitoring with competitive landscape and also the needs once we get to that point to determine if we need to make any adjustments in that particular sales force sizing that we've got currently.\n",
      "Chris, the only thing I would also add, obviously, everybody's concern about safety of the new class of drugs like the GLP-1s but I would also point your attention to the really strong efficacy data that's accumulated on once weekly. If you just go through each of the durations trials, I think you'll walk away pretty darn impressed with what these drugs could potentially do for the treatment of diabetes. And that will obviously also be all factored in by the FDA.\n",
      "That will come from the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.\n",
      "Just a follow-up on Byetta LAR. Byetta sales in the U.S. continued to decline and my question is, to what extent does this affect your view on the EQW opportunity? And how important is having a robust Byetta base on that launch? I think initially our expectations, the street's expectation would be that LAR would significantly drive increased penetration to the GP community. If you could comment on that. And then John, back to Effient, just curious, expectations are $500 million to $1 billion for this opportunity and potentially even larger, and I'm just wondering is there a point in time -- is there an inflection point we should be looking for at which all formularies include Effient or until -- at what point do we say -- or at what point do you feel that you have enough information to be able to sort of reset expectations?\n",
      "Jami, I think the results so far following the launch in August as I said earlier, do not diminish our believe that Effient is going to be an important product. Obviously, we're not in the business of forecasting the peak sales, everyone out there has their views. But I think if you go back and you look at the data and you look at the opportunity we have, whether it's in distinct patient subsets or the broader question around the effectiveness of the molecule, the consistency. I should say the effectiveness of the molecule relative to other choices, we feel just as good about Effient today as we did when we launched the product. So I think it's too early to say that we should reset expectations. I think physicians are increasingly of a mind to ask how should the product be used, in which patients should I use the product. So I think I'm very reluctant to say after six months, we could declare this or declare that. We're going to stay with it. We're going to continue to generate publications coming out of the large clinical trial that serve as the basis for the regulatory approval. We're going to continue to pursue the medical management indication as well.\n",
      "Jami, for the Byetta base and how that might influence Exenatide once weekly. Clearly, we had been hoping to have better performance in 2009 than we had. I think you may have heard some similar comments from Amylin yesterday. There were a variety of factors that contributed to that. We are intent on continuing to improve the performance of Byetta with a number of uncertainties now behind us with regard to approval of monotherapy and the label update that occurred late in the year. We'll continue to also monitor the progress of the Liraglutide or Victoza in a number of markets where it's already been launched. I think some of the early results for this class and what it means for Exenatide once weekly are promising. Where we have seen a number of the markets in Europe is pretty substantial expansion of the overall market size for GLP class. And again as I mentioned earlier, with the kind of efficacy data that we have generated for Exenatide once weekly, we think we'll be a very strong player with that product in that GLP space. So we're obviously anxiously awaiting the FDA review of our NDA, and very hopeful that this product will be very important in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes going forward.\n",
      "That will come from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays capital.\n",
      "John, just a little bit more on Effient and to some degree, Livalo if I may. Are only reps who are currently marketing Effient, will they be the ones marketing Livalo or is there other some other go to market strategy? I'm trying to get you to separate the financial aspects of this transaction, if in fact there is something more strategic. And then the second question more product-related, there was a movement of one drug, tasilulam (sic) [tasisulam], to Phase III. I'm curious given the Phase II trials is still is ongoing, what was the rational to move into that 800 patients Phase III trial which I think began in December. Dr. Paul, if you could help us there.\n",
      "Tony, I'm sorry I was distracted, your question on Effient. Tony, at this point in time, we don't anticipate adding incremental resources to support the launch of Livalo. We're going to be doing this in partnership with Kowa. We feel that the target physician audience for our message around Livalo is very well in line with the physician audience that we're calling on today in our efforts around Effient. So the product really sit well within the existing framework that we have in place.\n",
      "Tony, tasisulam, just to remind you, this is a very unique cytotoxic agent. Actually, as I think back and sort of reflect on the development of a limpid, it has many similarities. What we tend to do is when we develop oncologic agents as we tend to find activity in a given tumor, in this case, we found a good enough activity in a very difficult cancer metastatic melanoma to advance us into Phase III. And we feel very good about given the alternatives, the benefit risk for this particular disease is more than appropriate to advance that. We're enthusiastic about it. We have actually seen some other responses in some other tumors, ovarian cancer et cetera. Some very difficult cancers and we'll continue to do Phase II work with this molecule, and if we see additional responses that are better than standard of care, we will continue to think about additional Phase III trials. So again, given the unique method [ph] of actions compound effect that we've seen good activity in melanoma, that's what's prompted us to move this compound forward and move it into Phase III. Obviously, we'll be thinking about tailoring strategies, trying to find those patients that respond better to the agent just like we did with Alimta as we progress.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of Barbara Ryan with Deutsche Bank.\n",
      "I just had a question, Derica, for you and it's related to the sentence in the press release. We've had a lot of conversations surrounding the impact of currency fluctuations on your P&L, and there's a statement on Page 5 of your press release that basically says net income earnings per share declined blank and blank respectively excluding the impact of exchange earnings and earnings would have increased approximately 16%. Again, that's versus a decline of 11%. What we had discussed previously, in my understanding was that there was sort of a loss in the P&L where currency would have a net positive or negative impact on the topline, and that would be offset by an opposite effect on the gross margin and then clearly your expenses will fluctuate with that currency change on the topline as well. So I'm just wondering, if something's changed or I misunderstood, if you can just put that sentence in the press release in context relative to currency?\n",
      "The way I look at this is that, you saw dramatic movement in the exchange rate, the dollar versus the euro in the fourth quarter. And so you got an exaggerated effect in the P&L in the fourth quarter. However, if you look at that same effect over the 12 months, then you basically see it at a neutral level. And so if you look at our full year results both with and without FX, you do not see as much of a dramatic difference. And that's consistent with our inventory turns. So our inventory turns are about 12 months. So when we have those kinds of sharp movements, it takes about 12 months for the full effect to flow through our P&L. So when you saw that vast change in the fourth quarter, that's why you got the exaggerated effect in the gross margin in the fourth quarter. If you went back to the same period, being fourth quarter of 2008, you would've seen the opposite effect.\n",
      "One thing, Barbara, I'd also call your attention too, in December, we had provided a slide in the materials Derica has presented that looked at on a rolling four quarter basis, the gross margin as a percentage of revenue both with and without the FX impact of international inventory sold. It really seems to be the one that is moving a bit counterintuitively, if you will. We're going to have an update of that in the current quarter slide deck, the first supplementary slide if I recall correctly, I believe Slide 23. And what we've also done this time giving you by quarter for the last two years what the gross margin as a percent of revenue would have been without that impact. So I think you can look at that and begin to understand the magnitude of some of the effects we've had in a quarterly basis. This is in effect that if rates wherever they stay stable essentially would be a nonevent. There would be no impact from it. Unfortunately, that's not the current environment nor it will be in the future. But this hopefully will help you and your team to understand what are more of the underlying trends apart from this particular accounting effect that we do see in our international or in our cost of goods sold due to the foreign currency impact of international inventory sold in a given period. So we hope that's helpful to you guys.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of Eric Lo of Bank of America.\n",
      "Maybe another question on gross margins and FX impact as well. If you were to use current FX rates, what would be the impact to gross margins from currency for the first quarter? Second question, on cost restructuring program, do you have any update on the programs itself and how much of a cost savings may we see in 2010? And third question, on animal health, what's the outlook for sales in 2010 x U.S. and kind of pretty robust growth in our most recent quarter, what drove this?\n",
      "Let me start with -- if you take a look at where the current FX rates are today, while we're not prepared to give you specific estimates for the first quarter, we would expect to see an increase in our cost of goods sold due to the FX effect on inventory sold in the period if rates stay where they are currently. So you would see a similar effect of what you saw in the fourth quarter. However, we anticipate that that would dissipate or moderate as we go through the year and rate normalize out. Secondly, in regards to our cost reduction programs, we continue to make very good progress. If you look at our headcount that we'll be reporting, we'll probably be down year-on-year somewhere around another 500 or 600 employees. And so we're making programs to our ultimate goal of just 5,000 by the end of 2011. You'll also see in regards to our $1 billion cost reduction goal, we continue to make very good progress and what you're going to see is probably not one big announcement that will come out, but you will see a series of actions that we take to steadily pull those costs out. Beginning with actions that we did with TP that we announced with TP last year. So with us completing the Evonik deal and closing that on January 1 of this year, you'll see that that's one step towards reducing our cost basis. In regards to your third question, in regards to the animal health outlook, we actually saw a nice rebound in the animal health market in the fourth quarter. So in regards to our Dairy business, which also affects our rBST compound, we actually saw milk prices or dairy prices increase, which was a very positive for the milk producers and therefore, they were much more able to use the additives or the enhancements. And we saw that reflected in our fourth quarter results for our animal health. The question is, how sustainable would that be. So we are carefully monitoring that as we enter the year of 2010, we have not seen a significant change in the first few weeks of January, but it's still early.\n",
      "Do keep in mind Derek as you look at some of year-on-year changes and hopefully the slide we've provided in the back up Slide 23 will help. That as you look at year-on-year compares as we move through on a quarterly basis here in 2010, that we did have a substantial additional costs that we booked to cost of sales in both Qs 1 and 3 of 2009. And again as we've just discussed, we have a potential reduction in the -- we had a substantial reduction in the cost of sales in Qs 1 and 3 of 2009 and a substantial additional cost to cost of sales in Q4 2009. So your year-on-year compares in a number of these quarters, even if rates were to stay where they are today could be significantly swinging.\n",
      "I want to thank everybody for taking time this morning for this update on our company. We appreciate your continued interest. We're pleased with our performance and our progress in 2009. We're excited about the opportunities ahead of us this year. We have very strong financial performance in 2009, highlighted by volume-driven revenue growth. On a performance basis, that is excluding the effect of foreign exchange, we delivered increasing gross margin as a percent of revenue. We've got leverage between revenue and operating income growth and we demonstrated robust EPS growth. We prudently manage working capital in CapEx and once again generated strong operating cash flow. And we expect this strong financial performance to continue as Derica laid out in our 2010 guidance.We remain confident that this type of financial performance provides the resources we need to strengthen and progress our pipeline to invest in our transformation, allowing us to speed development and to improve our competitiveness in key therapeutic areas and geography, to streamline our cost base to deal with the patent explorations coming later this decade and to respond to a challenging healthcare environment.We move into the new decade poised to become a more efficient and effective company, one that remains focused on innovation. And with the pipeline that we expect to deliver long-term sustainable growth. As always, we will keep you informed of our progress. Have a great day.\n",

      "<bos>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q4 2009 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Phil Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.\n",
      "Good morning, and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly & Co.'s Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our President, CEO and Chairman, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Steve Paul; and Ronika Pletcher and Nick Lemen from Investor Relations.During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decision. You can access the earnings press release, supporting materials, a live webcast and Internet-based replay and a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com. The supporting materials, the replay and the podcast will be available on our website through February 26, 2009.We accomplished a great deal in 2009 by once again delivering strong financial performance in a tough environment. As well as by implementing a series of actions in the speeding innovation to patients and delivering greater value to our customers. Just as we have done in the past three quarters, in the fourth quarter, we generated strong volume-driven revenue growth. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, we also have generated an increase in gross margin as a percent revenue, leverage between revenue growth and operating income growth, robust EPS growth and strong operating cash flow. Our Q4 results capped a year of strong operating financial performance. This financial performance gives us the resources we need to strengthen and progress our pipeline, to invest in our transformation allowing us to speed development and improve our competitiveness in key therapeutic areas and geographies, to streamline our cost base, to deal with the patent expiration coming later this decade and to respond to a challenging healthcare environment.We will face our major patent expiration as a leaner more agile company. A company focused on innovation with a strong pipeline. Operating more efficiently and effectively and well positioned to resume sustained and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn the call over to John for a view of key events since our last earnings call.\n",
      "Thanks, Phil. Since our last earnings call, we continued our efforts to strengthen our operations and effectively utilize our resources typified by the following. Lilly signed a co-promotion agreement with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America to commercialize Livalo in the U.S. In addition, we entered into a licensing agreement with Kowa Company, Limited to market Livalo in Latin America. Livalo is a statin approved by the FDA in August 2009 for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. On January 1, 2010, the company completed the sale of its Tippecanoe manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana to Evonik Industries. Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb restructured our existing collaboration agreement to allow for the co-development and co-commercialization of necitumumab or IMC-11F8 in the U.S., Canada and Japan.Lilly also continued its effort to strengthen and advance our pipeline with the announcement of an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Incyte Corporation for the development and commercialization of Incyte's oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.On the regulatory front, Lilly received a number of regulatory approvals, including FDA approval of a Zyprexa Relprevv long-acting injection for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Byetta as monotherapy along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. And Zyprexa in tablet form as an option for the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adolescents.The European Commission approved Adcirca as a once daily treatment option to improve exercise capacity for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, or IPAH, and PAH associated with connective tissue diseases in WHO functional classes two and three. The product also received regulatory approval in Canada and Japan. And finally, Shinogi received approval from Japanese regulatory authorities of Cymbalta for the treatment of depression.Before passing the call over to Derica, I would like to take a moment to once again recognize the efforts of Steve Paul, who is participating today in his last earnings call for Lilly. Steve will retire at the end of February after 17 years of service to Lilly. Under Steve's leadership, we built the most robust pipeline in Lilly's history with more than 60 molecules in the clinic, including 29 in Phases II and III. Steve also helped recruit many of LRLs [Lilly Research Laboratories] top scientific leaders during his 17 years here at the company. And he's played a key role in transforming Lilly's R&D to position us for the future. Steve's successor will be Dr. Jan Lundberg, former Executive Vice President and Head of Global Discovery Research at AstraZeneca. Over the past decade, Jan had a hand in delivering some 150 drug candidates to AstraZeneca's pipeline. Dr. Lundberg received his training at Sweden's Karolinska Institute, where he spent 18 years involved in academic research before joining the industry. Now Derica will discuss our fourth quarter financial results.\n",
      "Thanks, John. As I've done on previous calls, I'll focus my comments on the pro forma non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view assumes we own ImClone as of January 1, 2008, and it excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. Now let's start on Slide 8 with a quick look at our fourth quarter income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a pro forma non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated strong revenue growth of 13% in the fourth quarter, while operating income fell 10%. This reduction in operating income was driven by a 6.4 percentage point drop in our gross margin percent. The decrease in gross margin percent from 82.3% to 75.9% is due to the unfavorable impact of cost of sales arising from the effect of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on the international inventories sold in the period. Specifically, changes in the foreign currency value of the U.S. dollar lowered cost of sales in Q4 of 2008 while increasing cost of sales in Q4 of 2009.In December, we shared information with you on the trend in our gross margin as a percent of revenue, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international inventories sold. Now many of you commented that this information was helpful. In the supplemental slides, you'll see that we've updated the slide we presented in December and that we have also provided gross margin as a percent of revenue for each quarter of 2008 and 2009, both with and without this FX effect.This quarter's operating expenses defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew slightly less than sale. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew 12%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside of the U.S. and the impact of foreign exchange rate. While R&D expense grew 10% due to increased incentive compensation and increased late stage clinical trial costs.Moving down the income statement, you will see the improvement in other income due to lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by about two percentage points. Net income and earnings per share declined 10% and 11%, respectively. Due to the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our cost of goods sold, as I previously mentioned.Now for the year, you can see that we generated leverage between revenue and operating income as revenue grew 5%, while operating income grew a robust 15%. This leverage between revenue and operating income was driven by a 2.2 percentage point expansion in our gross margin percent. Net income and earnings per share both grew 16%.Now Slide 9 shows our reported income statement while Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and pro forma non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q4 results starting with revenue. As you can see on Slide 11, for the fourth quarter, total revenue growth of 13% on a pro forma basis includes a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. After that impact, total revenue grew 10% driven by a robust 6% volume growth. This robust volume growth was consistent across all major geographies. Japan's substantial volume growth was largely driven by a Alimta's mid-2009 approval for both first line and second line non-small cell lung cancer.For the year, total revenue growth of 5% on a pro forma basis includes a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Absent that impact, total revenue grew 8% driven by 5% volume growth.On Slide 12, we provided the price, rate and volume analysis on a reported basis. Now let's look at the rest of the income statement.  Slide 13 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our pro forma non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. Now the numbers in the first column are the same as you saw earlier on our pro forma non-GAAP income statement. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the impact of foreign exchange rate on our pro forma non-GAAP results.First, for the quarter, you'll see the 10% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see a 3% growth in cost of sales, while operating expenses grew slightly less than revenue this quarter. The 9% performance growth in operating expenses was driven by increases of 9% in both marketing, selling and administrative expenses and R&D expenses. Our 10% performance growth in revenue translated into 15% performance growth in operating income and 16% in EPS. Finally, you'll see in the last column that for the year, we grew revenue faster than both cost of sales and operating expenses leading to 14% performance growth in operating income and EPS.Now for your information, on Slide 14, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. Comparisons of 2009 to 2008 operating income and EPS are not meaningful due to charges taken in 2008. Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. We reconfirm the 2010 financial guidance provided at our investor meeting in December. This guidance excludes the potential impact of healthcare reform in the U.S. And also as a reminder, our guidance reflects earnings per share of $4.65 to $4.85 on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. In terms of line item guidance, we expect total revenue to grow in the high single digits, driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, Animal Health, Effient and the exenatide franchise. We anticipate gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be flat to declining. However, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, we expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Research and development expenses are projected to grow in the low double digits. Other income for the year is expected to be a net deduction of between $150 million and $200 million and the effective tax rate for the full year should be approximately 22%.Finally, we expect cash flows to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend. Slide 16 provides a reconciliation between reported and pro forma non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2010 guidance. Now let me turn the call over to Nick and Ronica for our product review and pipeline update. Nick?\n",
      "Thanks, Derica. The last two quarterly calls, we discussed underlying prescription and shared market trends for several of our major products. Since we just provided detailed product updates at our meeting in December, this quarter, we'll take a look at three recently completed business development transactions. As mentioned earlier, in late December, Lilly entered into a co-promotion agreement in the U.S. and a licensing agreement in Latin America with Kowa to market Livalo. We are pleased to partner with Kowa and are excited to help bring this new statin to market. Livalo is in HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor approved by the FDA for patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol LDL-C, Apo B and triglycerides while increasing HDL-C. Livalo was approved by the FDA in August of 2009 and the drug has been marketed in Japan since 2003.This deal enables us to more effectively utilize our current sales force as it allows us to expand our product offerings in the cardiovascular therapeutic area, an area of high focus given the launch of Effient. While Livalo effectively lowers bad cholesterol similar to other prominent statins, Livalo will offer physicians an additional option for their patients who may not be responding to or tolerating their current treatment and for their more complex patients treated with multiple medications and at a risk of potential drug interaction that may occur with some of the currently available statins. Lilly and Kowa are working towards a mid-2010 launch of Livalo in the U.S., where Kowa will record sales and pay Lilly an undisclosed co-promotion fee based upon net sales. Under the U.S. agreement, the party shared cost of commercialization and development equally and Kowa is responsible for manufacturing the product while Lilly is responsible for distribution. The undisclosed upfront payment to Kowa will be amortized over the product's remaining patent life and will be booked to collaboration of the revenue. The agreement runs for the life of the patent, which has a current expiration date of January 2016. Kowa has applied for the five-year patent term extension.In Latin America, Lilly plans to submit Livalo to regulatory agencies during the second half of 2010, and hopes to launch Livalo by mid-2011. The agreement in Latin America is for a period of 10 years from product launch. In late December, Lilly also announced that it entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of Incyte's oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, INCB28050, currently in Phase II. The addition of this asset serves to further bolster our inflammatory and autoimmune disease pipeline. The asset is currently in an ongoing placebo controlled Phase II dose ranging study that has enrolled 100 patients with RA [rheumatoid arthritis]. After three months of treatment, patients in the placebo arm will crossover and receive active drug and the study will continue for another three months. We also plan to run a larger Phase IIb trial, which will generate the data necessary to inform dose selection for Phase III. To this point, there have been no scientific data disclosures on INCB28050. The current data disclosure plan includes sharing six-month data on the ongoing Phase II trial in patients with RA at the ACR meeting in October of this year. With Incyte also planning to share top line three-month results some time in the first half of the year.Lilly is very excited about this opportunity given that RA and other autoimmune diseases are chronic, debilitating diseases that still present an unmet medical need. The current therapeutic continuum typically starts with oral agents such as methotrexate but a significant proportion of patients are not well controlled. And therefore, typically move to biologics, most commonly the anti-TNFs. Even in patients receiving anti-TNFs, only about 50% achieve good ACR 50 response. Therefore, the normal treatment for these patients is to cycle one therapy to the next. If INCB28050 is successful with a favorable benefit risk profile, it could be positioned higher up the therapeutic continuum than anti-TNFs and therefore, not in direct competition with our own internal portfolio of biologics.We hope that our internal antibodies will be positioned at least initially as the treatment of choice following the failure of anti-TNF therapy. As safety and efficacy data on these assets increases, these compounds could assume a role as first line biologic after failure of oral therapy. Ronika?\n",
      "As John mentioned earlier, in January, Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb restructured our existing collaboration agreement to allow for the co-development and co-commercialization of necitumumab, or IMC-11F8, which is currently in Phase III clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer. Necitumumab is a fully humanized version of Erbitux. Lilly and BMS will share the cost of developing and potentially commercializing necitumumab in the U.S., Canada and Japan. Lilly retains full rights to the asset in other markets around the world.Now I'll provide a brief update on our pipeline. Our pipeline slide demonstrates changes since our December 10 Analyst Meeting as of January 21. The recent addition is in progress of our compounds further underline our robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 64 distinct entities, including 29 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We continue to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent nearly half of our late stage Phase II and III assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. Our focus remains unchanged, advancing our pipeline as our number one priority. As reflected by the arrows on Slide 20 since our last formal portfolio review, we have advanced one oncology asset to Phase I; promoted three assets to Phase II, one for diabetes, a glucose kinase activator, one for psoriasis our anti-IL-23 antibody and one for cancer, an Eg5 inhibitor. Added our previously mentioned, new in-lines [ph] of asset INCB28050 and JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor for RA in Phase II advanced Tasisulam to Phase III as first patient visit occurred in late December. Added Livalo to our co-promotion and licensing agreement with Kowa in the U.S. and Latin America and finally, one Phase I oncology asset was terminated.Now let's turn to Slide 21 to highlight selected milestones between now and mid-2010. Both Lilly and our partner, Amylin expect exenatide once weekly new [ph] several fronts including: potential action by the FDA on exenatide once weekly NDA; submission of exenatide once weekly to the European Medicines Agency; results from our DURATION-4 monotherapy trial; initiation of our exenatide one weekly cardiovascular outcomes study, EXSCEL, designed to show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes; as well as initiation of DURATION-6, our open-label study of exenatide once weekly versus liraglutide. For Cymbalta, we could have FDA action on the chronic pain sNDA and we will initiate the GLP-1 Fc Phase III AWARD program.This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please.\n",
      "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bert Hazlett at BMO Capital Markets.\n",
      "On the cardiovascular franchise, you licensed Livalo you've had the launch ongoing. What's the platelet blocker? Do you expect this to be an area where you focus on in terms of licensing? And then secondly, looking at your Zyprexa Relprevv long-acting risperidone is well above $1 billion globally, could you just frame your expectations for Zyprexa Relprevv?\n",
      "Bert, this is Phil. With the formation of our new structure, each of the various areas that we have designated will be focused on developing sustainable long-term businesses. That will include, not only advancing molecules that come out of our own research laboratories, but continued in-licensing and business development. With regard to Zyprexa Relprevv, we still view this as an important opportunity to provide additional attractive option for patients, particularly those that are difficult to control their symptoms of schizophrenia. We're currently in the process of rolling out that product in Europe. As you know, I think you're aware there are some significant requirements in terms of prepping the market, making sure that physicians in various centers are properly trained. Here in the U.S., we're in the beginning stages of a similar process and would expect to fully launch that product here stateside in the middle part of this year.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of Catherine Arnold at Credit Suisse.\n",
      "I wanted to get your reaction on some level to Effient's performance. I know you're building access, I know it's early days, I know we're in a different world in regards to launches and the uptake versus the same. Even considering all of that, I guess, I would think you would be disappointed with the early results of the product. And I wondered if you could react to that and tell me have you readjusted marketing plans? Have you changed the team? Is there anything going on behind the scenes that might sort of give us a little bit more confidence in sort of to change in execution here? And then could you talk about the Kowa deal in terms of if you don't hit financial targets for that collaboration, is there an opportunity to exit that down the road?\n",
      "Catherine, I think that first of all, it's important to point out that the indication we have approved for Effient, which is treatment for patients experiencing ACS who are undergoing PCI, it represents -- we have one slice in the pie in terms of the total range of indications that for example, the competitive product has. So I think we haven't made dramatic changes in direction, we're obviously responding as you would expect us to the inputs that we get from pairs, from our physician customers as we understand better what we need to do to get the product properly positioned, and to take advantage of a rather compelling data set to help physicians understand the advantages that we believe Effient can offer for many patients. So we're going to stick with the plans that we have in place now. we're pleased with the level of the access that we're gaining unrestricted in Tiers 2 and 3, the placement now of the product in the cath labs of hospitals that account for well over 50% of all the procedures, the stent placement procedures. So I think we're not put off by the initial results of this product by any means. We remain very confident in it. As you know, we have the medical management trial well underway now. So both companies, Lilly and Daiichi are going to continue to be thoughtful, but continue to be very supportive of making sure that Effient has the very best chance to succeed.\n",
      "One additional point on the Effient as well. We now have on hand some of the promotional materials that have been approved by DNMC. We'll be putting those in the hands of the sales reps starting in February, so we're excited about that. With regards to Kowa , we have not disclose the financial provisions or the termination provision to that agreement, Catherine. So unfortunately I can't help you with that question.\n",
      "Catherine, one last thing with regard to the building of access that continues to progress well as John mentioned. In December, we've had the hearing in the U.S., we were currently approved in stocking [ph] cath labs that perform about 50% of PCIs here in the U.S. and that's now an excess of 60%. We'd like that to continue to build nicely over the coming month, so we are able to much more fully compete for those new patients coming on getting those stenting procedures.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of John Boris of Citi.\n",
      "First question just has to do with foreign exchange. Derica, can you just give us some color on what your assumption is for foreign exchange going into 2010? And then question on Cymbalta, the sNDA that was filed for chronic pain was scheduled to have ad comm and then the FDA canceled that. Does that have implications or have you been notified by the FDA about an extension of that PDUFA date or that commitment? And then can you provide any color on the last safety update that you provided to the FDA on Cymbalta? I would assume that that's something that's ongoing of which -- is there a label change on the horizon or something to that effect that you might be expecting? And then just on the rollout, if you were to secure approval, is Quintiles still instantly involved with -- the relationship with them, whether they would be assisting you in the rollout of that chronic pain indications?\n",
      "John, in regards to the FX effect on 2010, if rates were to stay where they are today, we would expect to see a modest improvement on both the sales line and the international income line associated with that versus the dollar. We would expect also see the opposite being of our cost of goods sold line, similar to what you've seen here in the fourth quarter of 2009. That would obviously, for the year it would be more modest than what you saw in the fourth quarter. But you would see an increase in our cost of goods sold due to the FX effect if rates stayed where they are today.\n",
      "John, on your three Cymbalta questions. The FDA has not communicated any kind of an extension to the PDUFA date. There has been no major amendment declared, so we still have the same PDUFA date that we had earlier. The safety information essentially was provided as part of the routine 120 days safety update. We did submit one new efficacy and safety study as part of that update, and that study did not show any new safety signal. And then lastly, there's not currently any active motion agreement with Quintiles. As you may recall from the original agreement, they will have a residual payment coming to them over the next three years as a result of their original involvement with the promotion of the product.\n",
      "And that will come from the line of Tim Anderson at Sandsford Bernstein.\n",
      "This is Jay Olson for Tim Anderson. First, could you please share with us your latest thinking about the competitive landscape in the GOP-1 category, with the recent approval of Victoza and how that might impact Byetta? And secondly, your thoughts on the potential risk for therapeutic substitution of Cymbalta with Zyprexa when it goes generic later this year and how you plan to manage that?\n",
      "I think the launch of Liraglutide here in the U.S. obviously changes the landscape here. But keep in mind they've been -- that product has been available in Europe for a number of months now. One of the things that we've observed in a couple of those markets in Europe is that the overall market in this category is expanding. And so I think that to some degree, if that happens here, all boats will rise as it were. We're going to emphasize in the process of meeting the competitive challenge of the entry of the second product. We're going to emphasize the fact that we have treaters Byetta has been used in over 1 million patients. I think there have been 10 million or so prescriptions written. We think we have a very good understanding of the benefit risk profile of Byetta to products that's been used and trusted by physicians and patients. And I think that base of experience we have will be important. Obviously, we're looking forward to the approval of the once-weekly version of Exenatide, which we think has the potential to offer even more advantages.\n",
      "In relation to the competition that could come with generic effects or later, we continue to believe the Cymbalta's got a unique profile that positions it quite strongly in the marketplace. With the approved indications in major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, DPMP in fibromyalgia. That position will be further strengthened should we received the approval in chronic pain. As we have presented in December 2009 as well as December 2008, even with strong generic competition already in that marketplace with a variety of products that have gone generic, as well as the launch of Pristiq for example, Cymbalta has continued to perform quite well among those branded products. So we're optimistic about the future despite the continued generic pressures that we will see.\n",
      "And we'll go to the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.\n",
      "Could you please comment on the outlook for FORTEO going forward, what type of growth you're expecting? And also discuss the implications of Denosumab if that's approved? And then second, could you just discuss the key type line events that investors should be watching in 2010 beyond LAR?\n",
      "With regards to FORTEO, we feel very good about the lift we've gotten so far with the FORTEO connect program, where we have a more hands-on approach of helping patients initiate therapy and stay on and work through their therapy. So we saw a good start to that program last year, and we hope to continue to see good subscription to that program going into 2010 as well. With regards to Denosumab, we really believe that Denosumab is again going to be viewed as a resorptive, much like some of the disphosphonates (sic) [diphosphonates] and could be positioned similar to Reclast. We believe that FORTEO continues to be unique and that it is an anabolic and it does build new bone. And so we feel that there is still going to be a strong for FORTEO, even with the potential strong competition from Denosumab.\n",
      "Dave, with regards to pipeline events, I'm going to initially make my connection with two of the movements that were recently announced, at least today, announced with regards to IL-23. IL-23 was promoted into the next phase. Later this year, we should have that proof of concept data available. I'm not sure what medical meeting it will be available at, but that's some new information that will be out there as well as our GKA [Glucokinase Activator] as well, we'll have a data presentation or publication later next year. But that was one of the two that were promoted. We also hope to have some Phase II phase advanced data with regard to the hitmion [ph] compound early this year as well. And also something that's gotten a lot of attention with our GLP-1 Fc program, the initiation our Award program which is the full Phase III program.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan.\n",
      "Just a series of GLP-1 questions. I would starting with that GLP-1 Fc Phase III program. Just also update us in terms of just how we should think about timing of completion of that program, how long we should expect on that front? And now you're monitoring gall stone levels with that Phase III program? Maybe then taking a step back as it relates to the GLP-1 portfolio. Do you expect the black box warning you saw on your competitor's label is going to be something that's product specific or something that could be applied to all long-acting GLP-1s until there's more information on this? And then finally, when you receive FDA approval for Byetta LAR, do you need to expend the resources dedicated to the GLP-1 franchise or should we think about support maybe in line or is partly seeing on Byetta?\n",
      "In terms of the GLP Fc timing of completion, at this point the team is essentially finalizing protocols. A number of these are likely to appear over the next few months. So I prefer to wait to comment on the potential timing until that process has completed, Chris, but that should be something again, I'd say within the next couple of months. Trials will be finalized and protocols posted to clinicaltrials.gov for that Award program. My expectations would be it's likely we wouldn't measure capitone [ph] unclear based on some of the discussions that you may have seen and communications from FDA as they talked about the regulatory approval, whether or not these are particularly meaningful. And in fact, whether implementing this in practice could in fact lead to additional surgeries that are really not necessary. Black box being product specific, clearly each one of these products does have a different data set with regard to pre-clinical and clinical data. In the case of Byetta and the Exenatide molecule, we also have a substantial amount data from the marketing of the product over the last five years or so. So our expectation would be that the FDA will in fact look at the data sets that the different companies have generated for the different molecules to make a determination of what the appropriate labeling is for that molecule. And in terms of expanding resources, my understanding is that at this point in time, we are essentially resourced along with Amylin to support our launch of Exenatide once weekly. Obviously, we'll be monitoring with competitive landscape and also the needs once we get to that point to determine if we need to make any adjustments in that particular sales force sizing that we've got currently.\n",
      "Chris, the only thing I would also add, obviously, everybody's concern about safety of the new class of drugs like the GLP-1s but I would also point your attention to the really strong efficacy data that's accumulated on once weekly. If you just go through each of the durations trials, I think you'll walk away pretty darn impressed with what these drugs could potentially do for the treatment of diabetes. And that will obviously also be all factored in by the FDA.\n",
      "That will come from the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.\n",
      "Just a follow-up on Byetta LAR. Byetta sales in the U.S. continued to decline and my question is, to what extent does this affect your view on the EQW opportunity? And how important is having a robust Byetta base on that launch? I think initially our expectations, the street's expectation would be that LAR would significantly drive increased penetration to the GP community. If you could comment on that. And then John, back to Effient, just curious, expectations are $500 million to $1 billion for this opportunity and potentially even larger, and I'm just wondering is there a point in time -- is there an inflection point we should be looking for at which all formularies include Effient or until -- at what point do we say -- or at what point do you feel that you have enough information to be able to sort of reset expectations?\n",
      "Jami, I think the results so far following the launch in August as I said earlier, do not diminish our believe that Effient is going to be an important product. Obviously, we're not in the business of forecasting the peak sales, everyone out there has their views. But I think if you go back and you look at the data and you look at the opportunity we have, whether it's in distinct patient subsets or the broader question around the effectiveness of the molecule, the consistency. I should say the effectiveness of the molecule relative to other choices, we feel just as good about Effient today as we did when we launched the product. So I think it's too early to say that we should reset expectations. I think physicians are increasingly of a mind to ask how should the product be used, in which patients should I use the product. So I think I'm very reluctant to say after six months, we could declare this or declare that. We're going to stay with it. We're going to continue to generate publications coming out of the large clinical trial that serve as the basis for the regulatory approval. We're going to continue to pursue the medical management indication as well.\n",
      "Jami, for the Byetta base and how that might influence Exenatide once weekly. Clearly, we had been hoping to have better performance in 2009 than we had. I think you may have heard some similar comments from Amylin yesterday. There were a variety of factors that contributed to that. We are intent on continuing to improve the performance of Byetta with a number of uncertainties now behind us with regard to approval of monotherapy and the label update that occurred late in the year. We'll continue to also monitor the progress of the Liraglutide or Victoza in a number of markets where it's already been launched. I think some of the early results for this class and what it means for Exenatide once weekly are promising. Where we have seen a number of the markets in Europe is pretty substantial expansion of the overall market size for GLP class. And again as I mentioned earlier, with the kind of efficacy data that we have generated for Exenatide once weekly, we think we'll be a very strong player with that product in that GLP space. So we're obviously anxiously awaiting the FDA review of our NDA, and very hopeful that this product will be very important in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes going forward.\n",
      "That will come from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays capital.\n",
      "John, just a little bit more on Effient and to some degree, Livalo if I may. Are only reps who are currently marketing Effient, will they be the ones marketing Livalo or is there other some other go to market strategy? I'm trying to get you to separate the financial aspects of this transaction, if in fact there is something more strategic. And then the second question more product-related, there was a movement of one drug, tasilulam (sic) [tasisulam], to Phase III. I'm curious given the Phase II trials is still is ongoing, what was the rational to move into that 800 patients Phase III trial which I think began in December. Dr. Paul, if you could help us there.\n",
      "Tony, I'm sorry I was distracted, your question on Effient. Tony, at this point in time, we don't anticipate adding incremental resources to support the launch of Livalo. We're going to be doing this in partnership with Kowa. We feel that the target physician audience for our message around Livalo is very well in line with the physician audience that we're calling on today in our efforts around Effient. So the product really sit well within the existing framework that we have in place.\n",
      "Tony, tasisulam, just to remind you, this is a very unique cytotoxic agent. Actually, as I think back and sort of reflect on the development of a limpid, it has many similarities. What we tend to do is when we develop oncologic agents as we tend to find activity in a given tumor, in this case, we found a good enough activity in a very difficult cancer metastatic melanoma to advance us into Phase III. And we feel very good about given the alternatives, the benefit risk for this particular disease is more than appropriate to advance that. We're enthusiastic about it. We have actually seen some other responses in some other tumors, ovarian cancer et cetera. Some very difficult cancers and we'll continue to do Phase II work with this molecule, and if we see additional responses that are better than standard of care, we will continue to think about additional Phase III trials. So again, given the unique method [ph] of actions compound effect that we've seen good activity in melanoma, that's what's prompted us to move this compound forward and move it into Phase III. Obviously, we'll be thinking about tailoring strategies, trying to find those patients that respond better to the agent just like we did with Alimta as we progress.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of Barbara Ryan with Deutsche Bank.\n",
      "I just had a question, Derica, for you and it's related to the sentence in the press release. We've had a lot of conversations surrounding the impact of currency fluctuations on your P&L, and there's a statement on Page 5 of your press release that basically says net income earnings per share declined blank and blank respectively excluding the impact of exchange earnings and earnings would have increased approximately 16%. Again, that's versus a decline of 11%. What we had discussed previously, in my understanding was that there was sort of a loss in the P&L where currency would have a net positive or negative impact on the topline, and that would be offset by an opposite effect on the gross margin and then clearly your expenses will fluctuate with that currency change on the topline as well. So I'm just wondering, if something's changed or I misunderstood, if you can just put that sentence in the press release in context relative to currency?\n",
      "The way I look at this is that, you saw dramatic movement in the exchange rate, the dollar versus the euro in the fourth quarter. And so you got an exaggerated effect in the P&L in the fourth quarter. However, if you look at that same effect over the 12 months, then you basically see it at a neutral level. And so if you look at our full year results both with and without FX, you do not see as much of a dramatic difference. And that's consistent with our inventory turns. So our inventory turns are about 12 months. So when we have those kinds of sharp movements, it takes about 12 months for the full effect to flow through our P&L. So when you saw that vast change in the fourth quarter, that's why you got the exaggerated effect in the gross margin in the fourth quarter. If you went back to the same period, being fourth quarter of 2008, you would've seen the opposite effect.\n",
      "One thing, Barbara, I'd also call your attention too, in December, we had provided a slide in the materials Derica has presented that looked at on a rolling four quarter basis, the gross margin as a percentage of revenue both with and without the FX impact of international inventory sold. It really seems to be the one that is moving a bit counterintuitively, if you will. We're going to have an update of that in the current quarter slide deck, the first supplementary slide if I recall correctly, I believe Slide 23. And what we've also done this time giving you by quarter for the last two years what the gross margin as a percent of revenue would have been without that impact. So I think you can look at that and begin to understand the magnitude of some of the effects we've had in a quarterly basis. This is in effect that if rates wherever they stay stable essentially would be a nonevent. There would be no impact from it. Unfortunately, that's not the current environment nor it will be in the future. But this hopefully will help you and your team to understand what are more of the underlying trends apart from this particular accounting effect that we do see in our international or in our cost of goods sold due to the foreign currency impact of international inventory sold in a given period. So we hope that's helpful to you guys.\n",
      "We'll go to the line of Eric Lo of Bank of America.\n",
      "Maybe another question on gross margins and FX impact as well. If you were to use current FX rates, what would be the impact to gross margins from currency for the first quarter? Second question, on cost restructuring program, do you have any update on the programs itself and how much of a cost savings may we see in 2010? And third question, on animal health, what's the outlook for sales in 2010 x U.S. and kind of pretty robust growth in our most recent quarter, what drove this?\n",
      "Let me start with -- if you take a look at where the current FX rates are today, while we're not prepared to give you specific estimates for the first quarter, we would expect to see an increase in our cost of goods sold due to the FX effect on inventory sold in the period if rates stay where they are currently. So you would see a similar effect of what you saw in the fourth quarter. However, we anticipate that that would dissipate or moderate as we go through the year and rate normalize out. Secondly, in regards to our cost reduction programs, we continue to make very good progress. If you look at our headcount that we'll be reporting, we'll probably be down year-on-year somewhere around another 500 or 600 employees. And so we're making programs to our ultimate goal of just 5,000 by the end of 2011. You'll also see in regards to our $1 billion cost reduction goal, we continue to make very good progress and what you're going to see is probably not one big announcement that will come out, but you will see a series of actions that we take to steadily pull those costs out. Beginning with actions that we did with TP that we announced with TP last year. So with us completing the Evonik deal and closing that on January 1 of this year, you'll see that that's one step towards reducing our cost basis. In regards to your third question, in regards to the animal health outlook, we actually saw a nice rebound in the animal health market in the fourth quarter. So in regards to our Dairy business, which also affects our rBST compound, we actually saw milk prices or dairy prices increase, which was a very positive for the milk producers and therefore, they were much more able to use the additives or the enhancements. And we saw that reflected in our fourth quarter results for our animal health. The question is, how sustainable would that be. So we are carefully monitoring that as we enter the year of 2010, we have not seen a significant change in the first few weeks of January, but it's still early.\n",
      "Do keep in mind Derek as you look at some of year-on-year changes and hopefully the slide we've provided in the back up Slide 23 will help. That as you look at year-on-year compares as we move through on a quarterly basis here in 2010, that we did have a substantial additional costs that we booked to cost of sales in both Qs 1 and 3 of 2009. And again as we've just discussed, we have a potential reduction in the -- we had a substantial reduction in the cost of sales in Qs 1 and 3 of 2009 and a substantial additional cost to cost of sales in Q4 2009. So your year-on-year compares in a number of these quarters, even if rates were to stay where they are today could be significantly swinging.\n",
      "I want to thank everybody for taking time this morning for this update on our company. We appreciate your continued interest. We're pleased with our performance and our progress in 2009. We're excited about the opportunities ahead of us this year. We have very strong financial performance in 2009, highlighted by volume-driven revenue growth. On a performance basis, that is excluding the effect of foreign exchange, we delivered increasing gross margin as a percent of revenue. We've got leverage between revenue and operating income growth and we demonstrated robust EPS growth. We prudently manage working capital in CapEx and once again generated strong operating cash flow. And we expect this strong financial performance to continue as Derica laid out in our 2010 guidance.We remain confident that this type of financial performance provides the resources we need to strengthen and progress our pipeline to invest in our transformation, allowing us to speed development and to improve our competitiveness in key therapeutic areas and geography, to streamline our cost base to deal with the patent explorations coming later this decade and to respond to a challenging healthcare environment.We move into the new decade poised to become a more efficient and effective company, one that remains focused on innovation. And with the pipeline that we expect to deliver long-term sustainable growth. As always, we will keep you informed of our progress. Have a great day.\n",
